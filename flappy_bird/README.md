# Flappy Bird AI with NEAT

An AI-powered Flappy Bird game where the bird learns to navigate through obstacles autonomously using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. This project demonstrates how genetic algorithms can train neural networks to solve dynamic challenges in a simple game environment.

## üéØ Features
- NEAT Algorithm: Evolves neural networks to control the bird's jumps.
- Autonomous Gameplay: The AI learns to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible.
- Collision Detection: Real-time collision checks between the bird and obstacles/screen boundaries.
- Configurable Parameters: Adjust fitness functions, network structures, and game physics via `config.txt` and `DATA.py`.
- Visualization: Watch the AI improve over generations with Pygame rendering.

## üß† How It Works

### NEAT Algorithm
- Inputs to Neural Network:
  - Bird's current `y` position
  - Distance to the top and bottom of the upcoming obstacle gap
  - Bird's vertical velocity
- Output: Decision to jump (if output ‚â• `0.5`)

### Fitness Function
- Rewards:
  - `+10` for passing an obstacle
  - `+0.01` per frame survived
- Punishments:
  - `-5` for collisions with obstacles or screen boundaries

### Obstacle Mechanics
- Obstacles spawn continuously with randomized gaps
- Speed: Moves left at 2 pixels per frame

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BestNeatBirdGame.py` | Main entry point for running the NEAT-based Flappy Bird simulation.         |
| `Bird.py`             | Defines the bird's behavior, including physics and NEAT-controlled logic.   |
| `config.txt`          | Configuration file for NEAT hyperparameters and network settings.           |
| `DATA.py`             | Centralized configuration for game physics, colors, and dimensions.         |
| `Game.py`             | Implements the manual Flappy Bird game with Pygame visualization.           |
| `NeatGame.py`         | Visualizes the NEAT training process with Pygame.                           |
| `NeatSimulation.py`   | Runs the NEAT training loop without visualization for faster evolution.     |
| `Obstacle.py`         | Handles obstacle generation, movement, and collision detection.             |

## üìö Learning Notes
Key takeaways from this project:
- NEAT simplifies neuroevolution by dynamically adjusting network complexity
- Fitness functions must balance short-term rewards and long-term survival. (I mean if bird keeps crashing, it's not my ‚Äî it's the bird's fault. Right?)
